To help people with terminal for mac (because its pretty fun to mess around with)

So, the best one I mostly use is the "nano" command, it can help you edit your files in terminal without having to go inside the file
CD - This stands for "Change Directory", so if you wanna go to your desktop, you're gonna want to start a new Terminal session and type "cd Desktop" or without the capital D,
ls - this will show you the stuff in the directory, so if you don't wanna check yourself you can just use "ls" and it will type out all the stuff in the Directory.
Curl - this is mostly used to download stuff. Like github files, I will make a github text for you to copy!
